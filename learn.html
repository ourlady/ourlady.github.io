  <p>This is the Nicene Creed, which explains the beliefs of the Catholic faith.</p>
  <p><b>
I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
<br><br>
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.
<br><br>
Who, for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.
<br><br>
And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father [and the Son]; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.
<br><br>
And I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.</b></p>
<p>This is the faith of the basis of Christianity, including Catholicism. For an introduction to Catholicism, read <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/catechism-of-st-pius-x-1286">The Catechism of Saint Pius X</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the three most essential prayers in the Catholic faith. I recommend you pray them, and think about God as you do. Make this a habit.</p>
<h3><b>The Lord's Prayer: Our Father / Pater Noster</b></h3>
<p>Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
<h3><b>Hail Mary / Ave Maria</b></h3>
<p>Hail, Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>
<h3><b>Glory Be / Gloria Patri</b></h3>
<p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>
